# Statistical modelling

My homeworks for the course of statistical modelling (master's degree).
Almost all the solutions are written in R.

## Task 1

Consider a gamma distribution with $$\lambda = 8$$ and $$\alpha = 0.5$$.

1. `TASK1/lab1/charac/distAnalys.r` sample from the gamma distribution and calculate statistical characteristics.
2. `TASK1/lab1/parEst/parEst.r` parameter estimation using the moment method and maximum likelihood method.
3. `TASK1/lab1/chiSquare/chiSquareTest.r` Pearson's chi square test.
4. `TASK1/lab1/shapiroWilk/shapiroWilkTest.r` Shapiro-Wilk test.

## Task 2

Consider 20 benches, 5 of which are painted red, other 6 are green and 9 the rest are blue.
Let's sit 9 times on 9 randomly chosen benches.
What will be the probability of your pants being painted in all three colors after those 9 sits?
The solution is provided in `TASK2/sem2/benches.r`.

## Task 3

1. `TASK3/lab3/lab3.Rmd` confidence intervals.
2. `TASK3/sem3/` hypothesis tests.

## Task 4

1. `TASK4/lab4/lab4.Rmd` correlation analysis.
2. `TASK4/sem4/sem4.Rmd` dispersion analysis, non-parametric homogenety tests.

## Task 5

`TASK5/sem5/sem5.Rmd` correlation and regression analysis.

## Task 6

`TASK6/lab6/lab6.Rmd` unsupervised classification.

## Task 7

`TASK7/lab7/lab7.Rmd` supervised classification.
